# Uber Sentimental Analysis using Deep Learning 

### ➡️ The repository consists of Code & Datasets used for the sentimental analysis of Uber 

### ⚫️ Project Insights

1️⃣ Reading the CSV file from Twitter containing the Tweets 

2️⃣ Creating columns for the tweets & category (Positive & Negative)

3️⃣ Cleaning the tweets for irrelevant information & symbols 

4️⃣ Generating Vocabulary with the help of Google Word2Vec

5️⃣ Using ANN for creating model and testing the same 

6️⃣ Using CNN for creating model and testing the same
